# CoolHost: a Template
CoolHost is a little one-page template for simple host landing pages. 
It runs on Bootstrap 5 and is pretty light to use so you could just stick it up on your webserver and have a functional landing page for your hosting service.

Please leave the note in the footer which annotes I created the page, don't remove it.
If you have found someone has removed it, feel free to open an Issue Request on this repo.

Feel free to customize everything else to your liking.
